PPP Pascal Pre Processor

Build dependencies:

Bison, Yacc and gcc. 

How To Use:

first run the build script. Then use the converter as this:

sh preprocess.sh defined_name input_file output_file

if no output file given, it creates a file named output.pas

if you want to use stdin/stdout, you can call ppp directly.
